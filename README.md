First up, this is **just for fun**. I'm building an MVC framework in Python as a challenge with a friend. He is similarly building one in C#. At the end we have to try and build something with them :)

- This is just for fun
- It's purpose isn't for any sort of production use, it will have security flaws and all sorts of badness
- I'm learning Python. I chose Python over Node.js so that I could (hopefully) really increase my Python knowledge during this
- I have never made a framework of any sort from scratch. Therefore many decisions will probably be horrendous.
